<!-- David Jagodowski - This is my attempt at the online profile project. I am submitting this
in addition to the "Easier" assignment just to demonstrate what I was able to do. 
I only worked on the main (index.html) page. The About, Portfolio, and Contact links in the header
are formatted as links... they just don't go anywhere.  -->

			<img class="textwrap" src="./assets/images/DJ_profile04.png" alt="Photo of Dave Jagodowski"> 
			<p>I am a technical writer and content developer with extensive experience documenting software, hardware, and firmware products in the computer and data-storage industry. I am currently studying web development at UNH so I expand my career beyond content creation and improve the way that "documentation" is accessed and delivered by incorporating intelligent design with video support to provide an effective and comprehensive solution.  </p>
			<p>Beyond my technical career, I am also an adjunct physics professor for several colleges in the Manchester, NH area. I understand that delivering a 3-hr physics lecture after an 8-hr work day may not be everyone's definition of relaxing, but I thoroughly enjoy the interaction with the students and the challenges that the job presents. </p>
